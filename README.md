## About Me
Hello there! Thanks for visiting my portfolio. I’m based in Singapore. My background is in Tech and Finance. I enjoy creating engaging projects demo, utilising a variety of tools such as Tableau, Power BI, SQL and Python.  Whether it's building interactive visualisations, analysing complex datasets, or developing data-driven solutions, I enjoy combining these technologies to effectively showcase my concepts and ideas. 

Feel free to add me on LinkedIn to stay connected and view more of my work.

     <td><b> <a href="https://github.com/hueeylow/python/blob/main/data_w_python.md" target="_blank">(1) Health Supplement Sales Visualisation with Python</a></b><br><br> 
Visualising data with Python unlocks powerful ways to transform raw data into actionable insights using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. In my illustration project, I leveraged multiple advanced visualization techniques to uncover trends, patterns, and performance drivers within the sales data of a Health Supplements Company. By presenting these insights through clear and interactive charts, I was able to highlight key opportunities for business growth and support data-driven decision-making.

Classification using logistic regression techqniue are often used machine learning technique for binary classification to predict the probability of an outcome and assigns a class based on a threshold. In this illustration, a use case was built with Hypertension dataset to analyse the patterns and predict the hypertension risk.

Some key features of the dashboard are – Test Execution Status, Performance Metrics, User Story Points Coverage, Defect metrics. The primary users are testers, developers, product owners, and business analysts who will leverage the dashboard to track testing progress, monitor defect status and prioritise issues. The dataset utilises self-populated data that mirror the likely challenges encountered in product development. </td>

     We are connected with data in almost everywhere of our lives. The collected data are often in complex and unstructured form that require data cleansing steps to transform them into a usable format, ensuring accuracy and reliability for further analysis and decision-making. In this demo, I will walk through some essential steps of data cleansing using SQL to process raw data for more effective use.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful scripting language where it helps to manipulate data in relational databases like Microsoft SQL, Oracle, mySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft Access. It is essential for data management and analysis in large organisations, enabling efficient extraction of valuable insights. Find out various ways to query a database, from basic data retrieval to more advanced operations in navigating a relational dataset.
